### Analysis:

#### Step 1: Summarize conversation before and after the target response:
- **Before the target response**: 
  - Speaker B reacts to Speaker A's comment about hanging up the phone after 10 minutes with "oh I see."
  - Speaker A then makes the target interjection: "I just wanted to make sure I was going to get one."
- **After the target response**: 
  - Speaker B continues by reflecting on their own behavior, mentioning they might have hung up too early and that the interaction felt strange.

#### Step 2: Notice the target text:
- The target text is: "i just wanted to make sure i was going to get one."

#### Step 3: Determine whether the target text is backchannel or not:
- A backchannel is a feedback response given to show attention or willingness to keep listening, without attempting to take over the conversation.
- The target response here is **not a backchannel**, as Speaker A is explaining their own thought process and advancing the conversation by clarifying their intention. Speaker A's interjection here is an attempt to provide additional context rather than giving supportive feedback to Speaker B.

#### Step 4: Determine backchannel type (if applicable):
- Since it is **not a backchannel**, this step is skipped.

#### Step 5: Classify "interjection type":
- The interjection type is **not backchannel**.

#### Step 6: Classify "emotion" and "sentiment":
- **Emotion**: The interjection reflects a calm and neutral state where Speaker A is explaining their reasoning. The emotion is **neutral**.
- **Sentiment**: The interjection is not emotional but rather explanatory, with no positive or negative sentiment. The sentiment is **neutral**.
