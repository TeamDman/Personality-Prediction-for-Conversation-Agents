### Analysis Steps:

1. **Summarize Conversation Before and After the Target Response**:
   - Before the target interjection, Speaker B talks about a conversation with a lady whose favorite meal is oatmeal and flax seeds, which Speaker B finds humorous.
   - After the target interjection, Speaker A responds with "that's pretty funny," and Speaker B transitions the topic to discussing an illness situation.

2. **Notice the Target Text**:
   - The target interjection is "[Laugh]" spoken by Speaker A in response to Speaker B's humorous comment.

3. **Determine Whether the Target Text is Backchannel or Not**:
   - The target interjection "[Laugh]" is not an attempt to take the speaking turn. It is instead feedback in response to Speaker B's statement about oatmeal and flax seeds being funny. Therefore, it qualifies as a backchannel.

4. **Determine Whether the Backchannel is Emotive or Cognitive**:
   - The "[Laugh]" interjection clearly expresses Speaker A's emotional reaction (amusement) to Speaker B's story. It does not reflect cognitive processing or thought processes.

5. **Classify "Interjection Type"**:
   - The interjection type is **emotive**.

6. **Classify "Emotion" and "Sentiment"**:
   - **Emotion**: The "[Laugh]" interjection conveys happiness and amusement.
   - **Sentiment**: The sentiment is **positive**, as the laugh reflects enjoyment and agreement with the humor.
