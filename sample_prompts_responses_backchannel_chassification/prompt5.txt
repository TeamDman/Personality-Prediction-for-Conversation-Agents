Your task is to classify the type of backchannel. There are two types of responses: turn-taking and interjections. We focus on interjections. We have two types of encouraging interjections (back-channel): emotive and cognitive.
The backchannel responses are feedbacks given while someone else is talking, to show interest, attention and/or a willingness to keep listening
Therefore, the interjections are not backchannels if the listener attempts to claim the speaking turn.

The Emotive class is one of the backchannel response, which is used to express the speaker's emotional state. The Cognitive class is another backchannel response used to reflect the speaker's thought processes or cognitive states. Your task is to classify the following interjection, delimited by triple backticks, into "emotive", "cognitive", "not backchannel".
The texts delimited by triple backticks contain the dialog and the target text response with '(TARGET)'.
Triple curly blankets indicate the position of the interjection. 

You also need to determine "sentiment" and "emotion" of the target interjection.
"sentiment" has 5 classes: 'very positive', 'positive', 'neutral', 'negative', 'very negative'.
"emotion" has 5 classes: 'neutral', 'sad', 'angry', 'happy', 'surprised'.

```
Target interjection text: i just wanted to make sure i was going to get one
The speaker who speaks the text inside triple curly blankets: A

Speaker B: oh really
Speaker A: but he said that it's okay to just hang up after 10 minutes too
Speaker B: oh i see {{{(TARGET) Speaker A: i just wanted to make sure i was going to get one}}} yeah see i think i hung up too early yesterday because this lady was a little weird
Speaker A: [StartLaugh] why [EndLaugh] she weird
Speaker B: well you know she was talking about these flax seeds a lot and she was from quebec [Pause] i do not know how i feel about the canadians altogether
```

Your response must include the classification result in JSON format at the end of the response.
You must perform analysis via following steps:
1. Summarize conversation before and after the target response.
2. Notice the target text.
3. Determine whether the target text information is backchannel or not.
4. [if backchannel] Determine whether the backchannel is emotive or cognitive. Note that if it's not backchannel, 'interjection type' becomes 'not backchannel'.
5. Classify "interjection type"
6. Classify "emotion" and "sentiment"
This is an example of JSON:
{
'interjection text': "i just wanted to make sure i was going to get one",
'interjection type': ...,
'emotion': ...,
'sentiment': ...,
}
