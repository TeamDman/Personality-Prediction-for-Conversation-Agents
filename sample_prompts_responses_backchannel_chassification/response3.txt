### Analysis:

#### Step 1: Summarize Conversation
- **Before the target response**: Speaker A is describing the unique social norms of New York City, where people typically mind their own business, even in unusual situations such as someone vomiting on a subway platform. Speaker B acknowledges this by saying, "that is true."
- **After the target response**: Speaker A provides a hypothetical example where people in other cities might react differently by asking if the person is okay. Speaker B responds with "right," agreeing with this observation.

#### Step 2: Notice the Target Text
- The target interjection is **"right"** spoken by Speaker B, placed in response to Speaker A's statement about how people in other cities might behave differently.

#### Step 3: Determine Whether the Target Text is Backchannel or Not
- The target text **"right"** does not attempt to take over the speaking turn but instead provides feedback to indicate attention and agreement. Therefore, it qualifies as a **backchannel**.

#### Step 4: Determine Whether the Backchannel is Emotive or Cognitive
- **Emotive** backchannels express the speaker's emotional state.
- **Cognitive** backchannels reflect thought processes or understanding.
- Here, **"right"** indicates cognitive acknowledgment, reflecting Speaker B's understanding and agreement with the point made by Speaker A. It does not convey an emotional state.

#### Step 5: Classify "Interjection Type"
- The interjection type is **cognitive** because it reflects comprehension and agreement.

#### Step 6: Classify "Emotion" and "Sentiment"
- **Emotion**: The tone of "right" is neutral. There is no strong emotional expression.
- **Sentiment**: The sentiment is **neutral**, as "right" does not convey positive or negative judgment.
