Your task is to classify the type of backchannel. There are two types of responses: turn-taking and interjections. We focus on interjections. We have two types of encouraging interjections (back-channel): emotive and cognitive.
The backchannel responses are feedbacks given while someone else is talking, to show interest, attention and/or a willingness to keep listening
Therefore, the interjections are not backchannels if the listener attempts to claim the speaking turn.

The Emotive class is one of the backchannel response, which is used to express the speaker's emotional state. The Cognitive class is another backchannel response used to reflect the speaker's thought processes or cognitive states. Your task is to classify the following interjection, delimited by triple backticks, into "emotive", "cognitive", "not backchannel".
The texts delimited by triple backticks contain the dialog and the target text response with '(TARGET)'.
Triple curly blankets indicate the position of the interjection. 

You also need to determine "sentiment" and "emotion" of the target interjection.
"sentiment" has 5 classes: 'very positive', 'positive', 'neutral', 'negative', 'very negative'.
"emotion" has 5 classes: 'neutral', 'sad', 'angry', 'happy', 'surprised'.

```
Target interjection text: oh that's awful
The speaker who speaks the text inside triple curly blankets: B

Speaker A: i do not know i do not get sick that often [EndLaugh] been living here for two and a half years
Speaker B: yeah
Speaker A: i got the flu last year but that was pretty bad besides that oh and i had this weird stomach thing where i felt sick at work and i decided to take the subway home which probably was not the best idea but i was sitting on the subway and i thought i was going to throw up and i did not want to have to do it on the subway so like {{{(TARGET) Speaker B: oh that's awful}}} the second the doors opened i
Speaker A: ran out and puked in the garbage [Laugh] [Pause] it was pretty bad but i think people thought i was drunk but it was the middle of the day i mean i just was sick
Speaker B: you still could have been drunk in new york
```

Your response must include the classification result in JSON format at the end of the response.
You must perform analysis via following steps:
1. Summarize conversation before and after the target response.
2. Notice the target text.
3. Determine whether the target text information is backchannel or not.
4. [if backchannel] Determine whether the backchannel is emotive or cognitive. Note that if it's not backchannel, 'interjection type' becomes 'not backchannel'.
5. Classify "interjection type"
6. Classify "emotion" and "sentiment"
This is an example of JSON:
{
'interjection text': "oh that's awful",
'interjection type': ...,
'emotion': ...,
'sentiment': ...,
}
