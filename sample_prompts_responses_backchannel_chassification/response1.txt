### Analysis

1. **Summary of Conversation**:  
   - **Before the Target Interjection**: Speaker B mentions "Charlottesville" and explains its location in relation to Richmond and Washington, D.C. Speaker A is listening and asks a clarifying question, "Where is that?".  
   - **After the Target Interjection**: Speaker B continues by elaborating on Charlottesvilleâ€™s location and later expresses positive feelings about living there.  

2. **Target Text**:  
   - The interjection "(TARGET) Speaker A: okay" occurs after Speaker B provides the location of Charlottesville.  

3. **Determining Backchannel vs. Turn-Taking**:  
   - The target text "okay" does not indicate that Speaker A is attempting to claim the turn or introduce a new topic. Instead, it serves as feedback to show acknowledgment and understanding of the information provided by Speaker B.  
   - **Result**: This is a backchannel response.  

4. **Emotive vs. Cognitive Classification**:  
   - The interjection "okay" reflects understanding or acknowledgment of the information rather than an emotional reaction. It is therefore a **cognitive** backchannel.  

5. **Emotion and Sentiment Analysis**:  
   - **Emotion**: The tone is neutral. There is no strong emotional reaction like happiness, sadness, anger, or surprise in the response.  
   - **Sentiment**: The sentiment is also neutral, as the interjection does not convey positivity or negativity, only acknowledgment.
