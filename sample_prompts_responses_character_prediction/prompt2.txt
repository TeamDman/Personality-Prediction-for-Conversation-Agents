Your task is to classify "Character" of the speaker in conversation using Big Five Inventory (BFI) Personality Traits. BFI includes five features: openness, conscientinousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, which is detailed as follows. We also display the opposite term for each class:
- "openness": intellectual, imaginative, independent-minded; opposite term is "closedness".
- "conscientiousness": orderly, responsible, dependable; opposite term is "lack of direction".
- "extraversion": talkative, assertive, energetic; opposite term is "introversion".
- "agreeableness": good-natured, cooperative, trustful; opposite term is "antagonism".
- "neuroticism": emotional instability, irritability, anxiety, self-doubt, depression; opposite term is "emotion stability".

We analyzed the real conversation between two speakers and summarize their behaviours. Your task is to classify the characters using those information and sample responses. Here, I define some words used in the analysis.
- "backchannel": The backchannel responses are feedbacks given while someone else is talking, to show interest, attention and/or a willingness to keep listening. 
- "emotive": The emotive backchannel is used to express the speaker's emotional state. 
- "cognitive": The cognitive backchannel is another backchannel response used to reflect the speaker's thought processes or cognitive states. 
- "interjection": Interjections are the responses that interject someone to stop talking and claim the speaking turn.

Additionally, we also show some sample responses spoken by the target speaker. We randomly extract some samples from 12-minute conversation. We excluded special tokens like commas, periods, or question marks. 

We put all information about the target speaker within the text delimited by triple backtics.

Sample Responses:
  Sample 1: go ahead i interrupted you
  Sample 2: oh i feel safe now i mean i felt safe you know because i know that i am from an area that i do not think anybody even knows
  Sample 3: yeah and i mean other than that i do not know what good it would do to be angry because i mean they can not find the people that done it because they are dead

  Sample 7: yes they say that he was behind it but i think that was more than just him behind it i mean they can not just blame it on one person to have so much power over so many people
  Sample 8: oh yeah i do not see why anybody would well i mean i could see some people doing it you know that may have been affected really closely by it but me myself i do not think that i would have changed you i was already married anyway so i do not think i would have went and jumped and got married and all that

  Sample 11: you know with them being all from well not all of them but most of them what 18 of them or something
  Sample 12: you know i know how they feel losing one but i do not know how they feel losing one to terrorists that
  Sample 13: yes [StartLaugh] so it makes you [EndLaugh] wonder then i mean i was scared right afterwards and you know i felt you know sad but yeah you know because there was a lot of people that died and i am sure there was probably everybody from every state that knew somebody because there was so many but that's about all i can think of is change for me but anything else has changed for you

Your response must include the classification result in JSON format at the end of the response.
You must perform analysis via following steps:
1. Summarize features you need to consider for predicting conversation characters.
2. Summarize the five conversation characters (BFI)
3. Determine the analyzed features related to each conversation character.
4. Summarize the sample responses.
5. Summarize the emotion distribution.
6. Summarize the sentiment scores
7. Summarize the basic statistics.
8. Classify the five conversation features with five options "highly aligned", "aligned", "neutral", "opposed", "highly opposed". Give "opposed" or "highly opposed" if the character is more aligned with the opposite terms.

This is an example of JSON:
{
'openness': ...,
'conscientiousness': ...,
'extraversion': ...,
'agreeableness': ...,
'neuroticism': ...,
}
