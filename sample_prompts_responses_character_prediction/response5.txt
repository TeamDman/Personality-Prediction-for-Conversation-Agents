### Step 1: Features for Predicting Conversation Characters
To classify the personality traits using BFI, we will consider:
1. **Sample Responses**: These provide insight into the speaker’s thought process, communication style, and emotional expressiveness.
2. **Emotion Distribution**: Proportions of emotions expressed such as anger, joy, sadness, and surprise help infer emotional stability and personality traits.
3. **Sentiment Scores**: Positive, neutral, and negative sentiments contribute to understanding agreeableness and neuroticism.
4. **Basic Statistics**: Metrics such as laughter frequency, backchannel usage (emotive and cognitive), and interjections reveal tendencies regarding extraversion, openness, and agreeableness.
