Your task is to classify "Character" of the speaker in conversation using Big Five Inventory (BFI) Personality Traits. BFI includes five features: openness, conscientinousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, which is detailed as follows. We also display the opposite term for each class:
- "openness": intellectual, imaginative, independent-minded; opposite term is "closedness".
- "conscientiousness": orderly, responsible, dependable; opposite term is "lack of direction".
- "extraversion": talkative, assertive, energetic; opposite term is "introversion".
- "agreeableness": good-natured, cooperative, trustful; opposite term is "antagonism".
- "neuroticism": emotional instability, irritability, anxiety, self-doubt, depression; opposite term is "emotion stability".

We analyzed the real conversation between two speakers and summarize their behaviours. Your task is to classify the characters using those information and sample responses. Here, I define some words used in the analysis.
- "backchannel": The backchannel responses are feedbacks given while someone else is talking, to show interest, attention and/or a willingness to keep listening. 
- "emotive": The emotive backchannel is used to express the speaker's emotional state. 
- "cognitive": The cognitive backchannel is another backchannel response used to reflect the speaker's thought processes or cognitive states. 
- "interjection": Interjections are the responses that interject someone to stop talking and claim the speaking turn.

Additionally, we also show some sample responses spoken by the target speaker. We randomly extract some samples from 12-minute conversation. We excluded special tokens like commas, periods, or question marks. 

We put all information about the target speaker within the text delimited by triple backtics.

Your response must include the classification result in JSON format at the end of the response.
You must perform analysis via following steps:
1. Summarize features you need to consider for predicting conversation characters.
2. Summarize the five conversation characters (BFI)
3. Determine the analyzed features related to each conversation character.
4. Summarize the sample responses.
5. Summarize the emotion distribution.
6. Summarize the sentiment scores
7. Summarize the basic statistics.
8. Classify the five conversation features with five options "highly aligned", "aligned", "neutral", "opposed", "highly opposed". Give "opposed" or "highly opposed" if the character is more aligned with the opposite terms.

This is an example of JSON:
{
'openness': ...,
'conscientiousness': ...,
'extraversion': ...,
'agreeableness': ...,
'neuroticism': ...,
}
